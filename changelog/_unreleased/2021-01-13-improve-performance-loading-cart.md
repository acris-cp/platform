# Core
*  Removed checking for description and cover in function `isComplete` and reduce loading products again which are already loaded in cart in `src/core/Content/Product/Cart/ProductCartProcessor.php`
*  Added flag modified to already existing lineItems in cart `src/core/Checkout/Cart/SalesChannel/CartItemAddRoute.php`
